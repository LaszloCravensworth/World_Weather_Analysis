# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project was to add a weather description to the weather data for a new product.  This way, when the beta testers input weather preferences, they can identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, they can choose 4 cities to create a travel itenerary.  Finally using the Google Maps Directions API, I was able to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
